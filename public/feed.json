I was born with a natural talent I have always been passionate about art I excelled in art classes. I realized that I was born to live in it but without conditions to be able to invest and without an adequate environment to study for some it seems a simple thing. about not having a very small table to meditate in my studies unfortunately its something I dont have. This dream will be realized only by believing in faith. I bought a house from my parents invested in my study and talent and had a house with a garden I've been following his work since he was crazy I'm a huge fan ...

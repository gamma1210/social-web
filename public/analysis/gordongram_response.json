A SECOND WOMAN and a RESTAURANT CRITIC whom you despicably and wholeheartedly terrorized her viciously with your uncalled for unnecessary horrible and brutal bullying threats and intimidation tactics from your grossy heinous rebuttal to two (2) female restaurant critics. Both of them never ever gave you such cruel comments and terrible criticisms. They were just doing they're job at being the most proper passionate ly appropriate news media writers who've absolutely done nothing wrong to you gordon ramsey. One female Asian critic living in the UK ( I think or assume she lives there) attended your brand new opening restaurant called the lucky cat restaurant. It seems she's the only Asian customer in your restaurant. Or what she describes in her experience while trying to enjoy herself. I forgot her name though but I will Google her information soon. Then you and your family decided to move to a second home at another town that's already infected by people with Coronavirus or probably in the atmosphere. You and your family were told by your local UK government to stay home and not get infected. Or don't travel around to other places so you and your family won't get infected. At least not spread the deadly virus. Unfortunately alot of rich wealthy people and celebrities like you gordon ramsey think you could do whatever you like and not care about what the common people or  descent humans would say to you when you take advantage of them and treat them like shit.","not that I'm taking sides here but have you not thought about the fact that he has 500 staff members let's assume all his staff are on minimum wage at 8.21 his restaurant open 12 hours a day 7 days a week. That means he will have to pay for 12weeks as I'm going off how long china was in lockdown for he would have to pay out over 4 million pounds when he isnt even making money for himself right now. He has a family to take care of and bills to pay. Just because he is worth 40mil that doesn't mean he has that much available. It just means all his businesses combined are worth that much. Also just because he is a celebrity doesn't mean you can target him. How about everyone else who isn't paying their staff and they've closed. Such as Mc Donald's primark  Companies that are worth alot. Do you write to them as well cuz pretty much every shop in the uk is closed apart from the supermarkets. Will you be having a go at them as well on their social media accounts If you are then fair play but if you are not then I suggest you stop with the criticism at a time like this just because he is a celeb.","Love this cannot wait for new series","so excited","me too gonna be the thing keeping me going during isolation","how about all those like myself who are not laid off but kept on at the expense of a much much smaller company","I cant explain that as I don't know what you do or what company you work for like I said I'm not taking sides. I know what people are going through because my partner has been laid off and luckily I'm on maternity leave so we are currently having to live off my money between me him and 2 children. The point I was trying to make is we don't know the ins and outs of every story and right now we shouldn't be judging people on their actions. If he isn't supporting his staff then thats his problem for the future because karma comes back around. But unless we have the reasoning why he isn't then we can't comment.","the point is that if other smaller businesses can support the people that helped give them their wealth why cant someone that is clearly much wealthier. Ate you going to comment on every post which is berating Ramsey or just mine as you asked a similar thing of me I think you are missing the point and sticking up for someone because they are a celeb.","and what does it matter what I do or who I work for the situation is still the same","FYI Gordon has paid his staff a months salary and any holiday pay they have left.
